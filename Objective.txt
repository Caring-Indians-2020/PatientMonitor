Our problem is to make a vitals monitor for patients in an isolated ward.

Scenario: Lots of patients, isolated ward, very few caregivers/responders. System to alert exactly who is in need of attention
Objective: Alert caregiver/responder to patient in distress, so they may intervene rapidly.

There will be a bunch of sensors to take continuous readings: ecg, blood pressure, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level.
These signals have to be processed and put together on a single clean display.
The individual measurements and associated circuits are fairly simple, you'll find them online easily. It's putting them together with a decision making software to sound an
 alarm that will be a little challenging.
Keeping in mind possible non availability of parts

Parameters to be measured
1) Blood pressure
2) Blood oxygen saturation level (aka pulse oximeter)
3) Electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform and some calculations pertaining the waveform (QT interval, RR interval)
4) Respiratory rate

Each measurement will be compared to thresholds provided by medical experts (lower and/or upper)
If measurement falls out of range, it should trigger an alarm
Thresholds must be modifiable for each patient as they may vary significantly.
